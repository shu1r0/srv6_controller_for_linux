# SRv6 Controller

This is an implementation of SRv6 in an SDN architecture[1] to study SRv6.

## Instrocuction
SRv6 is a mechanism to control networks flexibly.
However, it is difficult to build an environment for practical testing of SRv6.
To solve this problem, we develop an SRv6 controller that adopts the architecture of SDN.

The goal of this system is to be able to immediately deploy SRv6 networks for research and learning.
